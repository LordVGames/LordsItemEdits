# LordsItemEdits

There's a handful of items in RoR2 that I think aren't very fun/interesting or could be made more so. This mod will (eventually) have all my edits for items with that goal in mind.

## Current Item Changes

| Item  | New Description & Why |
| :-------------: | ------------- |
| **Pluripotent Larva** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/2/26/Pluripotent_Larva.png?771373) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57fcb543-a908-4342-aabf-c562f6e8b190) <br><br> Based on the logbook entry for the item and what the person who wrote the log said, the item's original function was to revive you as a void monster. So, I've replaced the item corruption effect with that original effect! <br><br> I've also made the effect more friendly by having you turn back to normal in the next stage after the item activates, since staying as a void monster for the rest of the run probably wasn't the original intention. On top of that,  you're can't respawn as a void reaver since their attack is so bad to play with, but you can always re-enable it if you *really* want to. You also can't respawn as a barnacle for obvious reasons. <br><br> Since this new effect would be VERY busted on engineer turrets, the item is now blacklisted from them. It's still possible for other AI to get the item, including Mithrix (if he manages to actually use the item before he gives you it back). Also don't worry about using another pluripotent larva while you're already a void monster, it'll still bring you back to your true original character in the next stage regardless of how many you use.


## Future Plans
- Making executive card a red item (it's basically a passive item already)
- Giving the unstable transmitter aura more use
- More(?)
