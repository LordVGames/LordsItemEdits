# SeekersPatcher

Patches ROR2 to add redirects for three things renamed / replaced in the recent patch that would prevent some mods loading.

Specifically, restores DLC2Content.Buffs/LowerHealthHigherDamageBuff, DLC2Content.Items/NegateAttack, DLC2Content.Items/GoldOnStageStart, DLC2Content.Items/LowerHealthHigherDamage, DLC2Content.Items/ResetChest, the old signature version of FireProjectile, PlayerCharacterMasterController.wasClaimed, GenericSkill.AssignSkill(SkillDef), CharacterBody.damageFromRecalculateStats, and CharacterModel.invisibilityCount.
