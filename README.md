# LordsItemEdits

There's a bunch of items in RoR2 that are either underwhelming, aren't very fun/interesting or can cause performance problems late-game. This mod will (eventually) have all my edits for items that fix one or both of those problems. All item edits can be configured on/off, with some having an additional setting(s).

## Current Item Changes

| Item  | New Description & Why |
| :-------------: | ------------- |
| **ATG** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/thumb/6/6a/AtG_Missile_Mk._1.png/128px-AtG_Missile_Mk._1.png?4f776c) | **NO IN-GAME DESCRIPTION CHANGE** <br><br> I've made the missiles work more like plasma shrimp, where they have a much shorter time to fly to the targeted enemy and are much less of a burden on performance compared to normal missiles. If you want the missiles to be faster but still be real missiles then check out [FasterProcChains](https://thunderstore.io/package/swuff-star/FasterProcChains/).
| **Bottled Chaos** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/4/42/Bottled_Chaos.png?7b1311) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68877cb1-9e58-4469-b6e9-937baece1905) <br><br> Bottled chaos gets a good equipment cooldown reduction added to it to help make your current equipment more useful while also helping bottled chaos work with itself since you'll be using your equipment more often now.
| **Electric Boomerang** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/8/8d/Electric_Boomerang.png?805d33) | <img width="960" height="132" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dfc71a0-af44-488a-86d3-8d3fcde3cc87" /> <br><br> Vanilla electric boomerang is usually able to permastun an enemy, or a few if they're lined up right, which makes fighting a lot of enemies completely free. This makes it synergize with skills that stun on hit, along with giving it a damage boost since it (mostly) won't be proccing as much. This will also still work on bosses, as long as the skill hit *can* stun.
| **Executive Card** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/8/82/Executive_Card.png?e23d0a) | ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26513a8e-6eee-4c5d-9bf9-b1ca19ea0df5) <br><br> Executive card now works more like an actual equipment and less like an elite aspect. The core functionality of getting more items from multi-shops and getting some money back from purchases is still there, but it's limited by the equipment's 80 second cooldown. <sup><sub>Yes this is an equipment and not a normal item but shush it's close enough.</sub></sup>
| **Molten Perforator** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/7/71/Molten_Perforator.png?3ab4b6) | <img width="923" height="114" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c3d1cb0-c7e0-4486-8695-43501dd80090" /> <br><br> Molten perforator is one of the few items that are a huge contributor to lag late-game. The item was kindof a mix between a single-target and AoE damage item, so I've designed this new iteration of molten perforator to be like that, albeit maybe more AoE than single target.
| **Pluripotent Larva** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/2/26/Pluripotent_Larva.png?771373) | <img width="915" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15be592c-1b01-43e1-8b18-b9ac71e2a600" /> <br><br> This brings back the old functionality of pluripotent larva described in the item's logbook entry: reviving as a void ally! (Except void barancles and void reavers by default) The old design made you stay as the void ally for the rest of the run, which is really not a good idea, so I've made it turn you back into your normal character when you enter the next stage.
| **Pocket I.C.B.M** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/f/ff/Pocket_I.C.B.M..png?c31388) | <img width="890" height="110" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8e0e663-acf8-48f5-9213-fae1e91db2f9" /> <br><br> Pocket I.C.B.M is another huge contributor to lag late-game with how many extra missiles it creates that then cause more proc chains leading to more lag. Now, the damage of fired missiles is tripled instead of firing 2 others, effectively being the same damage increase with the missile hit just with less procs afterwards.
| **Polylute** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/b/b5/Polylute.png?bd8f5e) | <img width="896" height="109" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9196a3aa-0c3b-435c-8f2a-4e22d2f482df" /> <br><br> To add to the item changes done mainly for late-game performance, I've made polylute stack damage instead of hit count. Effectively the same damage, but with less proc chains, so there's less lag and (kinda?) better balance.
