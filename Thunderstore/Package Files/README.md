# LordsItemEdits

There's a lot of items in RoR2, but some of them either aren't very fun/interesting or can cause performance problems late-game. This mod will (eventually) have all my edits for items that fix one or both of those problems. All item edits can be configured on/off, with some having an additional setting or 2.

## Current Item Changes

| Item  | New Description & Why |
| :-------------: | ------------- |
| **ATG** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/thumb/6/6a/AtG_Missile_Mk._1.png/128px-AtG_Missile_Mk._1.png?4f776c) | **NO IN-GAME DESCRIPTION CHANGE** <br><br> All I've done to ATG is make the missiles work more like plasma shrimp, where they have a much shorter time to fly to the targeted enemy and are much less of a burden on performance compared to normal missiles.
| **Bottled Chaos** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/4/42/Bottled_Chaos.png?7b1311) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68877cb1-9e58-4469-b6e9-937baece1905) <br><br> Bottled chaos gets a good equipment cooldown reduction added to it. Not only does it help make your current equipment more useful, but it also helps bottled chaos work with itself since you'll be using your equipment more often now.
| **Executive Card** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/8/82/Executive_Card.png?e23d0a) | ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26513a8e-6eee-4c5d-9bf9-b1ca19ea0df5) <br><br> Executive card now works more like an actual equipment and less like an elite aspect. The core functionality of getting more items from multi-shops and getting some money back from purchases is still there, but it's limited by the equipment's 80 second cooldown. <sup><sub>Yes this is an equipment and not a normal item but shush it's close enough.</sub></sup>
| **Molten Perforator** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/7/71/Molten_Perforator.png?3ab4b6) | <img width="911" height="109" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e7a5db9-7b57-45ab-8c93-f0de0f2c7344" /> <br><br> Molten perforator is one of the few items that are a huge contributor to lag late-game. The item was kindof a mix between a single-target and AoE damage item, so I've designed this new iteration of molten perforator to be like that, albeit maybe more AoE than single target.
| **Pocket I.C.B.M** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/f/ff/Pocket_I.C.B.M..png?c31388) | <img width="890" height="110" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8e0e663-acf8-48f5-9213-fae1e91db2f9" /> <br><br> Pocket I.C.B.M is another huge contributor to lag late-game with how many extra missiles it creates that then cause more proc chains leading to more lag. Now, the damage of fired missiles is tripled instead of firing 2 others, effectively being the same damage increase (although  there's a damage loss with less proc chains, but tbh that's for the better)
| **Pluripotent Larva** <br><br> ![](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/images/2/26/Pluripotent_Larva.png?771373) | <img width="911" height="107" alt="Risk_of_Rain_2_c44h7pAJHS" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5ff34c0-a344-47e1-9a04-c2cbc38aac50" /> <br><br> Based on the logbook entry for the item and what the person who wrote the log said, the item's original function was to revive you as a void monster. So, I've replaced the item corruption effect with that original effect! <br><br> I've also made the effect more friendly by having you turn back to normal in the next stage after the item activates, since staying as a void monster for the rest of the run probably wasn't the original intention. On top of that,  you're can't respawn as a void reaver since their attack is so bad to play with, but you can always re-enable it if you *really* want to. You also can't respawn as a barnacle for obvious reasons. <br><br> Since this new effect would be VERY busted on engineer turrets, the item is now blacklisted from them. It's still possible for other AI to get the item, including Mithrix (if he manages to actually use the item before he gives you it back). Also don't worry about using another pluripotent larva while you're already a void monster, it'll still bring you back to your true original character in the next stage regardless of how many you use.


## Current Modded Item Changes

| Item  | New Description & Why |
| :-------------: | ------------- |
| **Armed Backpack** *(Starstorm 2)*<br><br> <img width="128" height="128" alt="texIconArmedBackpack" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb458dc0-64c0-49b3-8fe8-0243db64e1e1" /> | **NO IN-GAME DESCRIPTION CHANGE** <br><br> I did the same change to this that I did to ATG: made missiles fired by this also work like plasma shrimp. This didn't really *need* the change, but I thought "eh why not", plus it can be toggled off if you don't want this.
| **Erratic Gadget** *(Starstorm 2)*<br><br> <img width="128" height="128" alt="texIconPickupErraticGadget" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c237f79c-a223-46a1-82ee-33103ae6bb6d" /> | <img width="850" height="108" alt="Risk_of_Rain_2_JiCYLIy2YT" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/148c9048-737e-4ed9-bb71-4e91537540b5" /> <br><br> I did a change to this similar to pocket I.C.B.M: swap out the extra procs for a damage multiplier. Erratic gadget doubled most lightning procs, so now it doubles the damage for some lightning procs instead which should help with late-game performance some. Erratic gadget's own proc effect is unchanged.
